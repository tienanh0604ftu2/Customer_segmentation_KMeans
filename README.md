# Online Retail Customer Segmentation using RFM Model and Data Mining

This repository contains a project analyzing customer behavior for a UK-based online retail business, using data from **01/12/2009 to 09/12/2011**. The company specializes in unique all-occasion gift-ware, with a customer base primarily consisting of wholesalers.

## Project Overview

Inspired by the study *"Data Mining for the Online Retail Industry: A Case Study of RFM Model-based Customer Segmentation using Data Mining"*, this project applies the **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM)** model to segment customers and derive actionable insights for customer-centric marketing strategies. By utilizing **k-means clustering** and **decision tree analysis**, customers are grouped based on their purchasing behavior.

## Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, transforming variables, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **RFM Segmentation**: Using the RFM model to create meaningful customer segments.
- **Clustering and Analysis**: Applying k-means clustering and refining results with decision tree induction to interpret customer segments.
- **Customer-Centric Recommendations**: Insights for optimizing marketing strategies to focus on high-value customers.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of all transactions from an online retail store between December 2009 and December 2011. It includes various transaction details such as invoice number, stock code, quantity, price, customer ID, and country.
